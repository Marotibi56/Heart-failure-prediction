 ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Prediction

A machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical records. This application can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and taking preventive actions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts risk of heart failure using patient health data
- Interactive web interface for data input (if applicable)
- Trained with machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Data visualization and analysis tools
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset** from [Kaggle / UCI Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

**Features include:**

- Age
- Anaemia
- High blood pressure
- Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level
- Diabetes
- Ejection fraction
- Platelets
- Serum creatinine
- Serum sodium
- Sex
- Smoking
- Time (follow-up period)
- DEATH_EVENT (Target Variable)

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (optional)
- Support Vector Machine (optional)

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

All models are evaluated using:

- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve & AUC
- Classification Report
- Cross-validation scores
